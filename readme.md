## Experience

### Upwork | Jul 2024 - Present
- 100% Job Success Score (Top rating)
- Designed and developed custom checkout experiences for applications with over 100k monthly visits
- Developed and maintained custom Chrome Extensions

> "After nearly three years of delays and setbacks with multiple developers who struggled to bring our web application and Chrome extension project to completion, we were fortunate to bring this freelancer on board. From the outset, he demonstrated not only technical expertise but also a strong sense of responsibility and commitment that had been sorely missing from previous attempts.
> 
> He inherited a codebase that was unstable, poorly documented, and riddled with issues—yet he quickly stabilized it with clean, durable, and efficient coding practices. His attention to detail was excellent; he took the time to fully understand the underlying requirements and nuances of the system, ensuring that nothing was overlooked or patched hastily.
> 
> What truly stood out was his honesty and transparency throughout the process. He communicated challenges clearly, proposed effective solutions, and delivered exactly what was promised. For the first time in years, we had a functioning, reliable product that met our original vision.
> 
> We were so impressed with his work that we retained him for additional feature upgrades and enhancements beyond the original scope. It’s rare to find a developer who combines strong technical skills with integrity and professionalism, and we would highly recommend him to anyone looking for high-quality development work done right the first time.
> 
> Looking forward into hiring him in our next phase!"
